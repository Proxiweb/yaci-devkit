## Multi Node Setup (Experimental)

While the primary purpose of DevKit is to provide a simple way to get started with a single devnet node, it is possible to use
DevKit to create a multi-node setup. The additional nodes can be mix of **block producing** nodes and **relay** nodes.

A multi-node setup can be useful for various testing scenarios.

The additional nodes can be on the **same machine** or on **different machines**. There are separate commands to start a block producing node or a relay node.

**You need to following steps in order to setup a multi-node setup:**

### 1. Setup Additional Node folders

#### Additional nodes on the same machine

In this case, you can copy the original `devkit` installation directory and rename it to `devkit2` or `node2` etc.

Update the `config/env` file to use a different **node name** and **ports** for the additional node.

```
node=node2

#######################################################
# Ports
#######################################################
HOST_N2N_PORT=3002
HOST_N2C_SOCAT_PORT=3334
HOST_STORE_API_PORT=8081
HOST_VIEWER_PORT=5174
HOST_CLUSTER_API_PORT=10001
HOST_SUBMIT_API_PORT=8091
HOST_OGMIOS_PORT=1338
HOST_KUPO_PORT=1443
```

#### Additional nodes on different machines

Install DevKit on the additional machines using standard installation instructions.

### 2. Start the main devnet node

Start the first devnet node using the `start` command with the standard steps. This will also act as our **main bootstrap node** or **admin node**.

```bash
devkit start

yaci-cli> create-node -o --start
```

**Note:** When we start a DevKit instance, it exposes a **cluster API endpoint** (default port **10000**) which is used to get the genesis files and other configuration
information while starting additional nodes.

You can check available cluster apis here http://localhost:10000/swagger-ui/index.html

### 3. Start DevKit instance for the additional node

Go to the additional node folder if it is on the same machine or login to additional machine.

- Start devkit in the additional node folder

```bash
devkit start
or,
./bin/devkit.sh start
```

### 4. Join to the main node to download the genesis files and create the node

1. Join to create a **block producing** node

```bash
yaci-cli:> join --admin-url http://<main_node_ip>:10000 --bp --overwrite --overwrite--pool-keys
```

- `--admin-url` is the cluster API endpoint of the main node. You can't use `localhost` here, you need to use the IP address of the main node.
- `--bp` is used to create a block producing node.
- `--overwrite` is used to overwrite the existing configuration files or node folder if it already exists.
- `--overwrite-pool-keys` is used to overwrite the pool keys with new keys. To use the previously generated pool keys, you can skip this flag.

This command will download the genesis files and other configuration files from the main node, create keys required
for the new block producing node and create the node folder.

2. Join to create a **relay** node

To create a **relay** node, just skip the `--bp` flag.

```bash
yaci-cli:> join --admin-url http://<main_node_ip>:10000 --overwrite
```

- `--admin-url` is the cluster API endpoint of the main node. You can't use `localhost` here, you need to use the IP address of the main node.

**Important:** Don't use `--name` flag in join command. This option will be removed in future releases. Using this flag may cause issues in the current version.

### 5. Start the additional node

After the join command is successful, you should be already in bp or relay node context in Yaci CLI.
Now, you can start the additional node using the `start` command.

```bash
devnet-peer/bp:default> start
```

### 6. Register the pool for new block producing node (Only for BP nodes)

If you have created a new block producing node, you need to register the pool for the new node, so that it can participate in the slot leader selection process.

```bash
devnet-peer/bp:default> register-pool
```

The above command will register the pool for the new block producing node with default options.

During the registration process, you can also see pool's owner address. You can now topup the owner address with some funds
to increase the stake amount of the pool. Topup enough ada, so that the new pool is eligible to create blocks.

In the below example, we are topping up the owner address with 650,000 Ada.

```bash
devnet-peer/bp:default> topup addr_test1qr3ew7uu9eg8asdupaqrpf9t7ug4l62jcxnpy96vl68xhwmvnkyw67tk4wptp7ggdsxw7ty5pwt4s4jjp7ykx68wrzwszqdxm8 650000
```

**Note**: You can also provide additional options while registering the pool. (Optional)

       Pool Ticker
       [Optional, default = DEFAULT_POOL]
