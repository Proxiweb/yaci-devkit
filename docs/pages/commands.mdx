## Common Commands
Yaci CLI commands are used to create and interact with the local devnet.

### create-node
To create a devnet node.
    - **Usage:**
    ```bash
     create-node [options]
     ```
   - **Example:**
Create a new node with the default options. 1 sec block time and overwrite the existing node if it exists.

   ```bash
    create-node -o --start
    ```
   - **Options:**
     - `--overwrite or -o boolean` : Overwrite the existing node if it exists.
     - `--start` : Start the node after creation.
     - `--block-time or -b double` : Set the block time in seconds. Default is 1 sec.
     - `--slot-length or -s double` : Slot Length in sec. Default is 1 sec.
     - `--epoch-length or -e int` : Epoch Length in slots. Default is 500.
     - `--era String` : Era (babbage, conway). Default is babbage.

**Note:** There are many other node specific configuration that can be set through env file. Please refer to the [Node Configuration](./node-configuration) for more details.

### reset

Reset local devnet. Delete data and logs folder and restart.

- **Usage:**
```bash
reset
```

If the devnet gets stuck or you simply want to reset the data and restart with the same configuration, simply use the command "reset".
It will restore your devnet to its initial state, allowing you to continue your development seamlessly.

### stop

Stop the local devnet.

- **Usage:**
```bash
stop
```
**Note:** You can stop the devnet using command "stop". This will stop the devnet and you can start it again using the "start" command.
The devnet will start from the last block it was stopped at. Based on the `securityParam` configuration in devnet node,
the node may get stuck if it is stopped for a long time. Please refer to the [Node Configuration](./node-configuration) to
know how to provide a custom value for `securityParam`.

### cluster

To switch to `devnet` mode for an existing devnet node when Yaci CLI is not in devnet mode.

- **Usage:**
```bash
yaci-cli:> cluster
```

### exit
To stop the node and other running services and exit from devnet node.

- **Usage:**
```bash
devnet:default>exit
```

Similarly, you can use the `exit` command in non-devnet mode to exit from the Yaci CLI.

### topup

To top up the address with the given ada amount.

- **Usage:**
```bash
topup [--address String] [--value double]
```

- **Example:**
To fund address with 45k ada.

```bash
topup addr_test1qrzufj3g0ua489yt235wtc3mrjrlucww2tqdnt7kt5rs09grsag6vxw5v053atks5a6whke03cf2qx3h3g2nhsmzwv3sgml3ed 45000
```

### default-addresses

To show the default addresses.

- **Usage:**
```bash
default-addresses
```

By **default**, the devnet is created with 20 default addresses at different derivation path from a test 24 words mnemonic
and each address is funded with 10k ada.
This is useful if you want to write your tests or tools using DevKit and you need some addresses to work with.
So, you know that these addresses are always available in the devnet.

**24 words mnemonic for the default addresses is:**
```
test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test sauce
```

### show-faucet-addresses

To show the faucet addresses.

- **Usage:**
```bash
show-faucet-addresses
```

The faucet addresses are the addresses that are used to fund the default addresses in the devnet and also used to top up the addresses using the `topup` command.

### utxos

To show the UTXOs of the given address.

- **Usage:**
```bash
utxos [address] [--pretty-print-inline-datum]
```

Example:
```bash
utxos addr_test1qrzufj3g0ua489yt235wtc3mrjrlucww2tqdnt7kt5rs09grsag6vxw5v053atks5a6whke03cf2qx3h3g2nhsmzwv3sgml3ed
```

```bash
utxos addr_test1qrzufj3g0ua489yt235wtc3mrjrlucww2tqdnt7kt5rs09grsag6vxw5v053atks5a6whke03cf2qx3h3g2nhsmzwv3sgml3ed --pretty-print-inline-datum
```

### tip

To show the tip of the node.

- **Usage:**
```bash
tip
```

### info

To show the info of the node.

- **Usage:**
```bash
info
```

## Log Commands

### logs

To show the logs of the node.

- **Usage:**

### yaci-store-logs

### ogmios-logs

To show the logs of the ogmios (if enabled).
