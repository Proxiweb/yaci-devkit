## Services

**Yaci DevKit** has the following optional services. You may want to enable or disable them based on your application's requirements or the client library you are using.

- **Yaci Store :** An indexer that provides Blockfrost-compatible API. It's useful if you're using a client library that relies on the Blockfrost API.
- **Ogmios :** A lightweight bridge interface for cardano-node. It offers a WebSockets API that enables local clients to speak
Ouroboros' mini-protocols via JSON/RPC.
- **Kupo :** Kupo is fast, lightweight and configurable chain-index for the Cardano blockchain.

By default, **Yaci Store** and **Ogmios** are enabled. While Yaci Store provides a Blockfrost-compatible API, it relies on Ogmios
to support the transaction evaluation endpoint (/api/v1/utils/txs/evaluate). This is useful if you're using a client library
that performs online script cost estimation via Blockfrost's transaction evaluation endpoint.

If you enable Kupo, a default wildcard "catch all" matching pattern is pre-configured.

## Configuration

Based on your requirements, you should enable or disable services in the `env` file to **minimize** the **runtime memory** footprint of DevKit.
Though, you can also enable or disable services using specific commands in yaci-cli, but it's recommended to use the `env` file for a persistent configuration.

### Location of env file
For zip based installation, the env file is located under installation directory ``config/env``.

For curl based installation, the env file is located under ``$HOME/.yaci-devkit/config/env``.

### Configuration options

- **yaci_store_enabled** : Enable or disable Yaci Store service. Default is `true`.
- **ogmios_enabled** : Enable or disable Ogmios service. Default is `true`.
- **kupo_enabled** : Enable or disable Kupo service. Default is `false`.
