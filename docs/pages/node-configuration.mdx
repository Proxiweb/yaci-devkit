## Node Configuration

Apart from a few options like `block time`, `epoch length`, and `slot length` which are provided through Yaci CLI,
other devnet node-related configurations can be configured through the `node.properties` file. The configurations defined in the
`node.properties` file will be used during devnet node creation.

For **zip** based installation, this file is located under installation directory ``config/node.properties``.

For **curl** based installation, this file is located under ``$HOME/.yaci-devkit/config/node.properties``.

Please refer to the `config/node.properties` file for all the node specific configurations.

## Example of few key configurations:

### securityParam
To set the security parameter for the node. Default value is 300. (300 blocks)

To change the configuration, add to the `node.properties` file

```shell
securityParam=<int value>
```

**Note:** If you want to stop your node for some time and restart it later without a reset, allowing it to continue from where
it left off and use existing data, you may want to set `securityParam` to a higher value.
Otherwise, the node may get stuck and you need to reset the node.

Let's say you want to stop your node and start the node again next day to continue from where it left off,
then you can set `securityParam` to a higher values like `86400` for 1 sec block time.

<Callout>
    Currently, for Devnet work, the security parameter is set to a reasonable value to improve the developer experience.
    For a real/multi-node network setup, please refer to this known issue/workaround: https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-devkit/issues/65#issuecomment-2318155838

### peerSharing

To enable or disable peer sharing. Default value is `true`.

### slotsPerKESPeriod

To set the number of slots per KES period. Default value is `129600`.

### maxKESEvolutions

To set the maximum KES evolutions. Default value is `60`.


**Note:** More configurations can be found in `node.properties` file.
