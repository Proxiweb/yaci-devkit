## Node Configuration

Apart from a few options like `block time`, `epoch length`, and `slot length` which are provided through Yaci CLI,
other devnet node-related configurations can be configured through the `env` file. The configurations defined in the
`env` file will be used during devnet node creation.

For **zip** based installation, the env file is located under installation directory ``config/env``.

For **curl** based installation, the env file is located under ``$HOME/.yaci-devkit/config/env``.

Currently, the following configuration can be done through env file:

### node.securityParam
To set the security parameter for the node. Default value is 300. (300 blocks)

To change the configuration, add to the `env` file

```shell
node.securityParam=<int value>
```

**Note:** If you want to stop your node for some time and restart it later without a reset, allowing it to continue from where
it left off and use existing data, you may want to set `node.securityParam` to a higher value.
Otherwise, the node may get stuck and you need to reset the node.

Let's say you want to stop your node and start the node again next day to continue from where it left off,
then you can set `node.securityParam` to a higher values like `86400` for 1 sec block time.

### node.peerSharing

To enable or disable peer sharing. Default value is `true`.

### node.slotsPerKESPeriod

To set the number of slots per KES period. Default value is `129600`.

### node.maxKESEvolutions

To set the maximum KES evolutions. Default value is `60`.


**Note:** More configurations will be added in the future.
